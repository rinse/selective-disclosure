Make claims on JWT selectively disclosable.

This implementation is based on [draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-07](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt-07.html) and will be outdated if along with the specification.

See [SD-JWT](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-selective-disclosure-jwt/) for the latest specification.
